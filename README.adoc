----

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. `src/pages/partials` is a folder into which we can put partial pages by convention.

There's nothing special about `src/components/` or `src/lib`.

== Created via

* `npm create astro@latest`
* `npm i htmx.org` and in Layout.astro add `<script src="htmx.org/dist/htmx.min.js"></script>`
* `npm i @picocss/pico` and in Layout.astro `import '@picocss/pico/css/pico.classless.css'`
